# Objective

I was tasked to refactor the code that my company Horseion has provided me for the assignment I the developer refactored the code in the HTML doc and the CSS style sheet I personally refactored the code to clean the sheet up using proper semantic tags as well as using css grouping on the style sheet. In doing this I simplified both the HTML and the css style sheet to make it easier for my peers or future coders to work on.
